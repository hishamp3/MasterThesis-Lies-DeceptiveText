# MasterThesis-Lies-DeceptiveText

Social media plays a vital role in connecting people worldwide and fostering interpersonal
connections. The vast reach of social media platforms means that any information
circulated through them carries the potential to influence a substantial global audience.
Consequently, Individuals find themselves frequently encountering potentially deceptive
content, Whether in the form of fabricated news, biased product appraisals, or lies
regarding various events and activities. While addressing this challenge, Several studies
have ventured into automated text-based deception detection using traditional Machine
learning algorithms, Recurrent neural networks and recently introduced Transformer
models.
Recent breakthroughs in Natural language processing have introduced more deceptive
content which is even undetectable at human level. The significant obstacle in
this scenario is the inherent difficulty in deciphering and comprehending the changing
underlying logic behind deceptive context. This thesis will focus on utilizing various
Transformer models and fine-tuning them for the target objective of detecting misinformation
and deceptive content. The thesis will explore different scenarios with utilization
of Linear classifier for supervised learning and Generative Adversarial Network classifier
for semi-supervised learning for deceptive statements and finally Question and
Answer classifier to tackle lies and misinformation content. These approaches will capitalize
on the versatility and robustness of Transformer models, Enabling a comprehensive
exploration of their potential in addressing various challenges related to deceptive
content.
