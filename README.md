# MasterThesis-Lies-DeceptiveText

Social media plays a vital role in connecting people around the world and developing
relationships. Social Media has a huge potential audience and the circulation of any
information does impact a huge population.People are regularly confronted with
potentially deceptive statements in the form of fake news ,misleading product reviews,
or lies about activities. There have been few works on automated text based deception
detection that have exploited the potential of nlp approaches.the main hurdle is the
lack of interpretability and potential to understand underlying logic and classify
deceptive statements.However the recent advancements in nlp have made it possible
with introduction of transformer based models.This thesis proposes to make use of
Bi-directional encoder representations from transformers(BERT) model for classifying
deceptive statements. The BERT model for supervised learning and GAN-based
BERT architecture for semi-supervised learning and finally chat-based QnA
architecture for tackling lies and misinformation problems.
